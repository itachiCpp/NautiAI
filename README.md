## 🌊 Features

### 💬 Multidisciplinary Engineering Q&A  
Ask natural language questions and receive accurate, context-rich answers across the entire subsea domain:
- 🌍 **Geoscience** (e.g., soil stability, CPT interpretation)  
- 🧱 **Structures** (e.g., templates, manifolds, jumpers)  
- 🧪 **Materials** (e.g., corrosion resistance, API 5L grades)  
- 🛠 **Installation Methods** (e.g., J-lay vs. S-lay, weather windows)  
- ⚙️ **Flow Assurance** (e.g., hydrate risk, slugging, wax management)  
All answers are grounded in standards such as **API**, **DNV**, **ISO**, and **NORSOK**.

### 📐 Design Calculators  
Compute key subsea parameters using built-in calculators:
- Buoyancy and submerged weight  
- Hydrostatic and external pressure  
- Collapse resistance and wall thickness (DNVGL/API-based)  
- Uplift force and soil bearing capacity  
- Flow assurance checks 

---

### 🧱 Material Selector  
Get recommended materials for subsea environments based on:
- Depth, pressure, and temperature  
- Fluid composition (e.g., presence of CO₂, H₂S)  
- Corrosion risk level and environmental conditions  
- Compliance with **API 5L**, **ISO 3183**, **NACE MR0175**, etc.
